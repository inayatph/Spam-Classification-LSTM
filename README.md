# Spam/Ham Classification
- This project focuses on implementing a spam/ham (non-spam) classification model using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) neural networks. 
- The goal is to accurately classify incoming messages as either spam or ham, aiding in filtering unwanted messages from legitimate ones.

## Key Components

- Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed to clean and tokenize text messages, converting them into a format suitable for training the model.

- Bidirectional LSTM Model: The core of the project is a Bi-LSTM neural network architecture, known for its ability to capture both past and future context in sequential data.

- Training and Evaluation: The model is trained on labeled data, and its performance is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
